**The TypeScript projects will feature:** App development w/ Angular, node.js, and Ionic 5

**To run these projects locally:**

- [ ] [Download the latest node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- [ ] Set up your Ionic app's folder structure on your computer.
- [ ] Install the Ionic cli on your computer's terminal: ``` npm install -g @ionic/cli ```.
       Note: -g: you're installing Ionic globally on your computer, instead of only at a local folder level.
- [ ] Create a brand new template for your Ionic app at the VSCode integrated terminal: ``` ionic start appName blank ```.
       Note: appName: name of your app - can be customisable. blank: [check Ionic documentation for app templates](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/cli/starters.html).
- [ ] Run your app via VSCode integrated terminal: ``` ionic serve -l```.
       Note: If this is your first time running this app, then press ``` y ``` to install ionic-lab.

** Note: When installing your Ionic app, you will notice that you have a ``` node_modules ``` folder. These projects within this Github respiratory will not feature
that folder, as the folder is simply too large and too complex to upload. So, it's recommended that you follow and update your project in accordance to the provide 
instruction. Should you need further help, [you can reach me here :)](donnyquickinc@gmail.com)
