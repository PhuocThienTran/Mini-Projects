# Types of Errors:
    # Syntax: Problems detected as program is parsed, due to arrangement of symbols
    # Logical Semantic: Errors made by a programmer
    # Unavoidable: Detected at run time

# Basic File Syntax:
    # aFile = open(path, mode="r"): r: read current file from the path
    # aFile = read(): read the entire file at once
    # aFile.readline(): Read a single line, newline (\n) appears at the end if the file ends with a newline
    # aFile.close(): always close the file at the end after opening it.
