# Comment: n/a

# Types of numbers:
# Natural: 1, 2, 3
# Rational: -1 = -1/1, 0 = 0/1, 0.5 = 1/2
# Integers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
# Irrational: sqrt(2), pi 3.14
# Reals: irrationals, rationals

# Continuous: Measurable things: Weight, length, speed. Use reals numbers
# Discrete: Only whole number things, especially when you are counting. Use naturals or integers
